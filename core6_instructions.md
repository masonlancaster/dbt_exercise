# dbt Exercise Instructions #
- Let's add dbt tests to our data warehouse and set it up to be refreshed on a schedule.

### dbt Testing ###
- There are 4 built in dbt data tests. We are going to add each test to our data warehouse so that we can see how they all work. There are many more tests you can add to your dbt project through packages and you can even write your own tests. We are just going to focus on the 4 built in data tests in this class.

- Login to GitHub
- Go to your repository you created when you set up dbt cloud
- Click Branches
    - New Branch
    - Call the new branch 'Core6'
    - Click Create New Branch

- Login to dbt Cloud
- Click Studio
- Click 'Change Branch'
    - Select the new branch we just created called 'Core6'


- We will add all of our tests in the `_schema_oliver.yml` file

#### unique ####
- The unique test ensures that each record has a unique value for a given field.

- Add a unique test to a model

```

```

- Run `dbt build -s dim_policy` to ensure that the test passes.

#### not_null ####
- The not_null test ensures no records have a null value for a given field.

- Add the not_null test to a model

```
```

#### accepted_values ####
- The accepted values test ensures that only certain values can be present in a given field

- Add the accepted values to a model

```

```

#### relationships ####
- The relationships test ensures that every key that exist on a table (usually a fact) also exists on the foreign table (usually a dim)

- Add the relationships test to a model

```

```
